# PLEXXIS Interview Exercise

This repository contains the code for the PLEXXIS Interview Exercise, which is a CRUD application built with React. The application interacts with a REST API to retrieve employee data and provides a user-friendly interface for managing employees. 

For this exercise, I decided to expand my skills by utilizing PostgreSQL as the database backend. Setting up the database and creating the necessary API endpoints for fetching, creating, and deleting employees took a good amount of my efforts as i've mainly worked with MongoDB, Firebase, and SQLServer in the past. To display the employee data, I employed the React Table component. Managing the application's state was achieved through the use of the React Context API.

## Requirements
- [X] Create a CRUD application that retrieves employees from a REST API.
- [X] Display the employees in a React application.
- [X] Implement UI mechanisms for creating and deleting employees.
- [X] Implement API endpoints for creating and deleting employees.
- [X] Edit the README.md file to provide an explanation of the project, your efforts, and other relevant information.

## Bonus Objectives
- [X] Use a relational database (SQLite, MariaDB, Postgres) to store the employee data.
- [X] Implement UI mechanisms to edit/update employee data.
- [X] Add API endpoint(s) for updating employee data.
- [X] Utilize React Table for displaying the employees in the React application.
